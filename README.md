# EDGAR-Data-Extractor

This is a Python project that uses `uvicorn` to run a basic application. The project includes a simple `main.py` script that prints "Hello, World!" when executed.

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. This application uses secedgar package that automates the file extraction in bulk.

## Codex-CLI

This is an Open AI code agent.
I at this point do not have access to the best model (codex-mini-latest) but i am using gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14

To Launch it use:
`coxex --model gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14`

## Claude Code

This is the Claude code agent.
I installed it but could not activate it because i do not have curently a MAX plan. ( i do have one but i canceled the renewal and i will reactivate once i return from Luca)

## GitHub Copilot Agent

There are two products under the same name (what do you expect from microsoft)...
I currently subscribed to "Pro" plan - this gives me the ability to use teh copilot on the VS Code only wiht unlimited code completions
If i upgrade it to "Pro+" Plan, i will gain the ability to lauhc a series of GitHubCoPilots in the cloud, via Git, by assignign the agent a defect. To do that the defect should be clearly defined and then i can let the agent run- the agent in this case will initiate a pull request and run wiht the changes so i do not have to keep approving everythign he does. It is expected that the agent will be able to run tests and prove the work assigned is fixed and will ask me to review his work priot to accepting the change.

I would love to see how good this is when i come back. For this i have to upgrad to Pro+ for 36 UDS/month. I can give it a try for a month
I would also like to read the best practive for ensuring hte agnet follows the coding style (i think for that i have to use the copilot-instructions.md but not only)
